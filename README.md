The reason why there isn’t many commits is because there was a problem with the repository, as I started using a different
machine and didn’t pull at the start, therefore I had to make a new one, towards the submission date which meant most of the 
website was already made by then.

I originally had a fourth tab (tab 3 – News tab) however I didn’t really like the design of the page and didn’t want to
fill my website with too much content and over crowd it, therefore I removed it. However, the code is still on notepad ++
I have just commented it out, just in case I bring it back in the future.
